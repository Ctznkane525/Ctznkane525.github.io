                    <p>
					Technology has been a passion for me since I was 3 years old.  I still remember playing with the old Timex computer with the tape deck alongside my father;  That sure was a lot of fun.<BR/><BR/>
					Times have sure changed.  Having been in software development for over 15 years, and in a management role for over 10, the things that most interest me now after continuous integration for the throughput and reliability it brings, cloud integrations for their balance between cost, reliability and elasticity and machine learning with the meaning it can derive against data.<BR/><BR/>
					When I'm not working or answering questions on Stack Overflow, you'll often find me at home with my lovely family.  I've been married since 2007, have two lovely daughers and a 80 lb friendly border collie lab mix.  Some of my free time is spent going back and forth to ballet courses, going to the gym and even occasionally on a round of golf.<BR/><BR/>
					Thank you for stopping by!
